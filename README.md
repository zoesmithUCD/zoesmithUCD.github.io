### Additional Computer Shortcuts
#### (If you want to be fancy) 

-   Ctrl+Z: undo

-   Ctrl+Y: redo

    -   Note: in RStudio, the default shortcut for redo is Ctrl+Shift+Z, not Ctrl+Y, because Ctrl+Y is assigned to a different command. You can change this (and other shortcuts) by navigating to Tools → Modify keyboard shortcuts… → search “Paste Last Yank” → disable it (i.e. click in the “Shortcut” section and delete the existing shortcut), or following the steps from the R team [here](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE)
    
-   Alt+D: selects the address bar (e.g. Google)

-   Ctrl+Backspace: delete the word left of the cursor

-   Win+(1-9): runs the program listed in the task bar according to its order. If the program is already running, it switches to it

    -   ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdMlo04cz9pWg6_r9i3tLLBzQfRincxfLOd4wnNZ51gTOq8CAFkTDCWozDWkmy-FiaaSMfs8cGvDD0i-MAKRq1Eyt02EwRGNKLWINpk-kOJaVJZ4RNA0IOpzKvIw465EoG7NF8h?key=YWdbpxiSjg1ykqZRVzbV5svS)

        -   Win+1 will open File Explorer

        -   Win+7 will switch to RStudio

-   Win+← (left arrow): snap window to the left

    -   Useful if you want to view multiple windows at once

-   Win+→ (right arrow): snap window to the right

-   Win+↓ (down arrow): make current window windowed

    -   Press Win+↓ an additional time to minimize a window

        -   Command+Control+F for macbooks

-   Win+Shift+S: opens a screenshot tool to take partial screenshots

    -   Command+Shift+4 for macbooks
 
## R-related shortcuts

R-Studios has a lot of great keyboard shortcuts that can save you time while coding. We have compiled a list of some that will be the most usefull for us in WFC 70. You can find a full list of R-related shortcuts by going to R-studios webcite, where they have compiled a couple different master sheets depending on what **program** (is this the correct term?) you're using. 

You can also easily see a list of shortcuts while in R-studios by clicling **Tools > Keyboard Shortcut Help**. Another way to view this is by using a keyboard shotcut yourself! To access this, type **Alt+Shift+K** for windows users or **Option+Shift+K** for macbook users. 


### 1) Running your code

You are able to use **Ctrl+Enter** (**Command+return** for macbook users) to easily run code in RMarkdown. This shortcut works from anywhere in the code line, so your cursor can be anywhere in the code and the entire command will run. You Don't have to be in the firts line of the command. 


### 2) Interting a Code Chunk

By using **Ctrl+Alt+I** (**Command+Option+I** for mackbook users), you can easilty make a new coding chunck in your markdown file. This will become more useful for when you get in to writing your final project. 

### Aditional R-related Shortcuts

-   **Ctrl+Shift+M**: inserts a piping tool

      -  **Command+Shift+M** for macbook users

          -  Note: this piping took is not the same one you will be introduced to in lab. It will look like this %>% insted of this |>. (ask Rob about the diferences)
